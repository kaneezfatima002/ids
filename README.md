4. Key Actions Taken
    a. Project Structure and Layout:
        Created the main structure of the website using HTML.
        Set up a navigation bar with smooth scrolling to different sections using JavaScript.
        Added sections for "About Us", "Portfolio", and "Contact Us" to showcase the design agency's services and past projects.

    b. Styling:
        Styled the website using CSS, including custom fonts from Google Fonts.
        Implemented a responsive design to ensure compatibility with different screen sizes using media queries.
        Added hover effects for better user interaction (e.g., on portfolio items, buttons, and navigation links).

    c. Form Validation:
        Created a contact form with validation using JavaScript.
        Ensured all fields are required before submission, and validated the email format to improve user experience.
        Added an alert to notify users of successful submission or errors.

    d. Portfolio Section:
        Created a portfolio section with three different project categories (Branding, Web Design, and Print Design).
        Added images for each project with descriptions and hover effects for better visual impact.

    e. Footer with Social Links:
        Added a footer with social media links (Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram).
        Styled the footer to maintain a professional and clean look, consistent with the rest of the site.

    f. Responsive Adjustments:
        Ensured that the layout adjusts well for mobile devices by stacking portfolio items vertically when the screen width is smaller.
        Implemented a flexible layout for various screen sizes using CSS flexbox and media queries.
